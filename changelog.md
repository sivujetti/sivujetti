## Added
- Content Templates Concept
    - Pages can now include pre-built content types, such as headers, content blocks, and footers.
    - Templates have preview images and are organized into separate tabs.
- Automatic Updater
    - All Sivujetti sites now periodically check for updates from the central server at sivujetti.org when logging into edit mode.
    - If updates are available, they can be installed with a single click.
    - The installation process first verifies that the server has everything needed for the update.
- Redo Support
    - All actions that could previously be undone (Undo) can now also be redone.
- External Image Support
    - Images for content, section backgrounds, and metadata social images can now be linked from external sources (e.g., `https://example-cdn.com/pic.jpg`).
- Image Captions
    - Captions (`<figcaption>`) can now be added to image content.
    - By default, captions appear below the image but can be repositioned using styles.
- Custom HTML Injection
    - Admin users can now define custom HTML code to be added to the `<head>` tag or at the end of the `<body>` tag of the final site.
    - This code is executed only in non-editing mode, making it suitable for analytics scripts and similar use cases.
- Improved Page Selection Filtering
    - Pages can now be filtered in the page selection widget.
- Wrapper Block Type
    - A new "Wrapper" block type has been added for grouping content.
- [JetForms plugin] Form submissions now support CAPTCHA methods (JetCaptcha, Google reCAPTCHA).

## Changed
- Reverted Style System
    - Simplified to a system similar to version 0.14.0.
    - Content no longer has default styles by default; developers can create styles in code and configure widgets for customization by non-developers.
    - All content templates come with preconfigured widgets.
- Content Added via Popups
    - Content is now added through popups accessed from context menus in the content tree, replacing the previous drag-and-drop mechanism.
- Reusable Content
    - Any content can now be saved as reusable, not just sections or columns.
- Page Visibility
    - Pages can now be set as hidden or published.
    - Hidden pages are visible only to logged-in admin users.
- Enhanced Listing Block
    - The default template for listing blocks now allows customization of displayed sections (e.g., title, link, article image).
- Nested Global Reusable Content
    - Global reusable blocks can now be nested within other content, such as using the same contact information block in both a page and a footer.
- Updated Visual Style Tools
    - The color picker now uses the [Coloris](https://github.com/mdbassit/Coloris) library instead of [pickr](https://github.com/Simonwep/pickr).
- Quill Editor Improvements
    - Clicking on text content now focuses directly on the clicked position instead of defaulting to the beginning.
    - Hovering over text content now highlights elements such as paragraphs and headers, not just the outermost element.
- Improved Image Listings
    - Image listings now support both grid and list views.
- Enhanced Links
    - Links can now point to the current page or be empty (e.g., only an anchor #anchor).
    - This allows anchor-only links without a path (`/path`).
- Menus
    - Submenus can now be added to menu links.
    - Menu links can now be reordered via drag-and-drop and duplicated.
- Improved Anchors
    - Anchors are now applied to individual words instead of entire paragraphs or header elements in the Quill editor.
- Drag-and-Drop Updates
    - Page previews are now updated only when content is dropped (onDrop), not continuously during dragging (onSwap).
- CSS Class Autocompletion
    - The text field for CSS classes now supports autocomplete using the [Tagify](https://yaireo.github.io/tagify/) library.

## Fixed

## Other
- Virtual DOM Rendering
    - Sivujetti now uses a virtual DOM-based rendering system (Preact), replacing the custom system.
    - This makes it easier for developers to add custom content block types, as they are now standard Preact components.
    - The backend still supports the older string/template-file-based system alongside the new one.
- Added an experimental ShortIdGenerator, which can generate block IDs that are 55‚Äì60% shorter than before.

# 0.15.0 (2023-09-13)

_Translated by ChatGPT._

## Added
- All content block types now have "standard styles" that every Sivujetti theme includes at a minimum.
    - These include items such as button colors, image height and width, section background colors, etc.
    - The complete list can be found at -> [std-styles.md (core)](https://github.com/sivujetti/sivujetti/blob/master/std-styles.md), [std-styles.md (JetForms)](https://github.com/sivujetti/plugins/blob/master/JetForms/std-styles.md) and [std-styles.md (JetIcons)](https://github.com/sivujetti/plugins/blob/master/JetIcons/std-styles.md)
- Styles are now divided into two categories - "derivable" and "legacy" styles.
    - Legacy styles are the same as regular styles from the previous version.
    - Derivable styles are versatile styles from which copies are made, inheriting the original style's variables. This allows for creating multiple "derivatives" that inherit some aspects of the original style but add their own modifications. Most standard styles are of this type.
- Styles now have two separate tabs in the additional details panel for technical users - code tab and visual tab.
    - In the code tab, styles can be added to the "storage," edited, but not added to contents.
    - In the visual tab, styles can be added and removed from contents but do not manage the "storage."
    - Only the visual tab is shown to end-users.
- Pages can now be deleted in edit mode (except for the homepage).
- In color-type widgets, you can now change the color value using a hex string.
- The type of value (px, %, rem) for length-type widgets can now be changed in visual styles.
- [JetForms plugin] Added a natural language-based editing tool for contact form contents, allowing you to instruct it on what actions to take when a user submits the form, such as "send filled data by email," "save data to a database," or "display a message to the user on the page at a specific location."
- [JetForms plugin] Added the ability to browse user-submitted form data in edit mode.
- [JetForms plugin] Added captcha support and a (time-based) captcha implementation.
- [JetForms plugin] The backend now displays form submission errors for logged-in admin users, making it easier to identify errors without searching through server logs.
- [JetForms plugin] Admin users can now define the value for each option in dropdowns and radio fields separately. Values are still auto-generated for non-admin users as before.
- [JetForms plugin] Contact form contents can now define a reply-to email address.

## Changed
- Navigation in edit mode now occurs by clicking links with the Ctrl / ‚åò key held down.
- The content highlighting box (highlight-rect) is now only displayed when hovering over content, whereas previously, it remained visible as long as the content was selected in the additional details panel.

## Fixed
- An issue where the "newest first" / "oldest first" sorting order didn't work correctly for list contents and page listings.
- [JetForms plugin] Fixed an issue where the email formatter for sent emails wrongly sanitized certain characters (√§, √∂).
- Various other üêõs, including:
    - Popup forms for editing list contents now stay in place more reliably.
    - Updating util classes was broken in some cases (e.g., when clearing).
